# Prototyping pre-trained models with Streamlit

After installing dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`, you can start the Streamlit app using `streamlit run file.py`.

All demos are in the `models/` folder. Currently, we only have one demo with GPT-2 in `models/gpt_demo.py`.

To start the GPT-2 demo, run `streamlit run models/gpt_demo.py`. The browser should automatically launch with the app, but if not, it can be found at http://localhost:8501/.
